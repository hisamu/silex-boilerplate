Silex Boilerplate
=================

This is just my personal Silex install, using Composer for just some basic dependencies and H5BP/Twitter Bootstrap for some CSS goods.

This enviromment is great for prototyping and for small apps.


Installation
------------

Get the install working with just these 3 lines:

    git clone https://github.com/hisamu/silex-boilerplate.git && cd silex-boilerplate
    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    php composer.phar install
